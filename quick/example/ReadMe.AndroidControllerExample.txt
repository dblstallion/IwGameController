Using Template: Marmalade Quick Project

Example for the Quick wrapper for IwGameController - cross platform
controller API.

Requires IwController (and extensions used by that) to be built into the Quick
binaries. Uses the OnScreenDPad and OnScreenButtons Quick helper modules.

This example copied and modified from the s3eAndroidController one.
